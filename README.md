Hello!

This is my realisation of JavaScript30 challenge

https://javascript30.com/

Source files of challenge
https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30

When working on projects, I strove for a deep understanding.
It leaded me to some refactoring and improving, fixing some obvious bugs
and expanding functionality as necessary.

Hope you will enjoy it!

Every project located in a separate folder.

To see the magic, just clone it and open index.html file.
